            <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Shianne Taylor and I'm from Pleasant Grove, Utah.
            I've been doing Technical Support for about three years, and I am ready for something more challenging.</p>
            
            <p>My love of computers started in the late 90s when my family got a brand new computer, and a subscription to AOL Online. 
            This was just before the great "Y2K Bug" scare.</p>
        
            <p>I made websites when as a teenager, but my knowledge of programming never progressed past basic HTML. 
            It wasn't until my late twenties when I started learning more programming. I've had the opportunity to use basic HTML, 
            CSS, and JavaScript at my job, but I'm still very much a novice.</p>
            
            <p>On a more personal note, I've been married to my wonderful husband, Thomas, for eleven years. 
            We'll be celebrating our twelth wedding anniversary in April 2020! No kids, but we do have three cats. Dotty, Loki, and Pumpkin.</p>
        
            <p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my husband, watching shows, playing video games and board games.</p>
